Autonomus Racing Car
This project focuses on the design and development of an autonomous racing car using Raspberry Pi 5, Arduino Uno, and computer vision, with integration of a mobile application for observation and control. The vehicle uses real-time motor control via Arduino, camera-based perception through the raspberry pi, and supervised learning algorithms to achieve autonomous control and racing. A Mobile application is developed for control through voice-based commands, live feed of the carâ€™s operations and troubleshooting features. Initially, inputs from the keyboards were used to manually control the car and collect data for training a deep learning model. This model predicts steering angle and motor control actions autonomously using the camera feed as the input. This system uses dual power supplies for stable operation and USB-based communication between the Raspberry Pi and Arduino. The project focuses on integration of embedded systems, computer vision, machine learning, and Iot to create a low-cost autonomous racing car.
